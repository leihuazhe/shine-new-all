# Java 7

## Features

* Collections API:
    * `TransferQueue<E>`
        * extends `BlockingQueue<E>` interface
        * implementated by `LinkedTransferQueue<E>`
        * blocking queue in which producer may wait for consumers to receive elements
        * it can publish an element and wait for consumers or just publish and forget
        * it can use a timeout to wait for a consumer
        * methods:
            * `getWaitingConsumerCount()`: returns an estimate of the number of waiting consumer to receive elements
              via `BlockingQueue` `take` or timed `poll`.
            * `hasWaitingConsumer()`: returns true if there is any waiting consumer.
            * `transfer(E)`: send an element and wait for the consumer.
            * `tryTransfer(E)`: send an element to a waiting consumer, return false immediately if there isn't any
              consumer.
            * `tryTransfer(E, long, TimeUnit)`: like `tryTransfer` but with a timeout to wait for a consumer before
              returning false.
